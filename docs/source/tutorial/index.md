# Tutorial

End-to-end demonstration of the Impact Engine Orchestrator using mock components.

The notebook walks through all five pipeline stages — MEASURE, EVALUATE, ALLOCATE, SCALE, and REPORT — showing intermediate results at each step. As real components are integrated, only the constructor calls change; the orchestrator logic stays the same.
